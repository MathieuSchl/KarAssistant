# Back-end node.js

    subgraph Backend
      subgraph You are here
        back{fa:fa-server Back}
      end
    end

    subgraph Clients
      app[fa:fa-mobile-alt Mobile app]
      console[fa:fa-terminal Console]
      homeAssistant[fa:fa-home Home assistant]
    end

    subgraph Agents
      agent[fa:fa-home Home agent]
    end

    app <--> back
    console <--> back
    homeAssistant <--> back
    back <--> agent
```

This is the main service.
It can receive, interpret and respond queries from the clients.
Each query will be interpreted and compared with a skills database.
Example: for the sentence `what time is it ?` the skill used concerns the time. The back-end will respond with the time `It's 12:15`.

One of our objectives is to set up physical agents at home, for example. They could operate on raspberries and control certain objects such as lights or shutters.

## How it's work

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    skills: Skills
    kara: Kara
    use: USE
    use2: USE
    user: User
    api: Api

    [*] --> kara
    skills --> use: Get skills
    use --> kara: Encrypt skills

    api --> use2
    use2 --> kara: Encrypt
    kara --> api
    user --> api: Request
    api --> user: Respond
```

USE = Universal Sentence Encoder

### You've missed the point ?

When the service starts up, skills will be in loaded. To do this, the `Universal Sentence Encoder` (USE) algorithm is used.
This will convert the samples sentences into vectors.
When a customer makes a request, the request phrase is embedded and compared with other vectors.
If the result of the comparison is close to 0, this means that the two sentences in question are similar and the skill code can be executed. The skill will then send the response sentence back to the client.
